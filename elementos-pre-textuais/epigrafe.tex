``No words can describe it\\
    No example can point to it\\
    Samsara does not make it worse\\
    Nirvana does not make it better\\
    It has never been born\\
    It has never ceased\\
    It has never been liberated\\
    It has never been deluded\\
    It has never existed\\
    It has never been nonexistent\\
    It has no limits at all\\
    It does not fall into any kind of category''\\
