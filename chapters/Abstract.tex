Shape, an important attribute in primate visual object recognition, has been widely explored in computer vision applications, such as objects classification, recognition and content-based image retrieval. A computer vision system for shape recognition performs shape analysis, which involves describe, or represent, shapes computationally and evaluate shapes similarity based on these representations. In this work we explore information theoretic concepts in shape analysis. We propose a new shape descriptor based on the multiscale curvature analysis of shape contour and on the differential entropy concept. Moreover, we apply divergence measures to evaluate shapes similarity based on histograms of its contour signatures. The proposed methodologies, for shape analysis and recognition, were tested in public domain shape images data sets, and its performances were assessed through data visualization techniques, clustering quality evaluation measures and shape classification and retrieval experiments. Our conclusion with this work is that information theoretic concepts can be successfully applied for shape analysis in description and similarity evaluation tasks.
