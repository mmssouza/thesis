  Abstract                 = {Species identification is a necessary component of most studies of biological diversity, and computational approaches are beginning to automate it. In particular, leaves of plants provide taxon-specific information that has successfully been applied to plant identification. Prior studies have not investigated the number of leaves or the resolution of the digitized leaf image required to represent a species' shape. Moreover, the relationship between accuracy and the size of the leaf shape database, and methods to integrate automated approaches with more traditional dichotomous keys have yet to be explored. Here, I use a database of 2,420 leaves from 151 species to address these issues. Using distance metrics derived from Fourier and Procrustes analyses, it is found that a minimum of 10 leaves of each species, 100 margin points, and 10 Fourier harmonics are required to accurately represent leaf shape of a species. These results are used to assess the success of species identification from images of leaves: 72% for all 151 species. The tight relationship between database size and accuracy is then used in conjunction with results from probability theory to predict accuracy of species identification when dichotomous multiple-entry keys and combined Fourier and Procrustes analysis are used together. Combining these two approaches to identification can greatly improve identification accuracy. Open-source software is available to implement the automated distance-based approach.},

  abstract =             {A comprehensive understanding of leaf shape is important in many investigations in plant biology. Techniques to assess variation in leaf shape are often time-consuming, labour-intensive and prohibited by complex calculation of large data sets. We have developed LeafAnalyser, software that uses image-processing techniques to greatly simplify the measurement of leaf shape variation. LeafAnalyser places a large number of evenly distributed landmarks along leaf margins and records the position of each automatically. We used LeafAnalyser to analyse the variation in 3000 leaves from 400 plants of Antirrhinum majus. We were able to summarise the major trends in leaf shape variation using a principal components (PC) analysis and assess the changes in size, width and tip-to-base asymmetry within our leaf library. We demonstrate how this information can be used to develop a model that describes the range and variation of leaf shape within standard wild-type lines, and illustrate the shape transformations that occur between leaf nodes. We also show that information from LeafAnalyser can be used to identify novel trends in shape variation, as low-variance PCs that only affect a subset of position landmarks. These results provide a high-throughput method to calculate leaf shape variation that allows a large number of leaves to be visualised in higher-dimensional phenotypic space. To illustrate the applicability of LeafAnalyser we also calculated the leaf shape variation in 300 leaves from Arabidopsis thaliana.},

  abstract =      {The diversity of life is one of the most striking aspects of our planet; hence knowing how many species inhabit Earth is among the most fundamental questions in science. Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts â¼8.7 million (Â±1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which â¼2.2 million (Â±0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86% of existing species on Earth and 91% of species in the ocean still await description. Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.},

 abstract = {Species identification is a necessary component of most studies of biological diversity, and computational approaches are beginning to automate it. In particular, leaves of plants provide taxon-specific information that has successfully been applied to plant identification. Prior studies have not investigated the number of leaves or the resolution of the digitized leaf image required to represent a species' shape. Moreover, the relationship between accuracy and the size of the leaf shape database, and methods to integrate automated approaches with more traditional dichotomous keys have yet to be explored. Here, I use a database of 2,420 leaves from 151 species to address these issues. Using distance metrics derived from Fourier and Procrustes analyses, it is found that a minimum of 10 leaves of each species, 100 margin points, and 10 Fourier harmonics are required to accurately represent leaf shape of a species. These results are used to assess the success of species identification from images of leaves: 72% for all 151 species. The tight relationship between database size and accuracy is then used in conjunction with results from probability theory to predict accuracy of species identification when dichotomous multiple-entry keys and combined Fourier and Procrustes analysis are used together. Combining these two approaches to identification can greatly improve identification accuracy. Open-source software is available to implement the automated distance-based approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Fine-grained leaf classification has concentrated on the use of traditional shape and statistical features to classify ideal images. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of traditional hand-crafted features and propose the use of deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) features. We introduce a range of condition variations to explore the robustness of these features, including: translation, scaling, rotation, shading and occlusion. Evaluations on the Flavia dataset demonstrate that in ideal imaging conditions, combining traditional and ConvNet features yields state-of-theart performance with an average accuracy of 97:3\%?0:6\% compared to traditional features which obtain an average accuracy of 91:2\%?1:6\%. Further experiments show that this combined classification approach consistently outperforms the best set of traditional features by an average of 5:7\% for all of the evaluated condition variations.},
