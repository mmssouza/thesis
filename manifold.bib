  abstract = {Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization.
	The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the
	fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover
	compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce
	locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm
	that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings
	of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality
	reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system
	of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local
	minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions,
	LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds,
	such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Large-scale data mining is often aided with graphic visualizations
	to facilitate a better understanding of the data and results. This
	is especially true for visual data and highly detailed data too complex
	to be easily understood in raw forms. In this work, we present several
	of our recent interdisciplinary works in data mining solar image
	repositories and discuss the over-arching need for effective visualizations
	of data, metadata, and results along the way. First, we explain the
	complex characteristics and overwhelming abundance of image data
	being produced by NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Then we
	discuss the wide scope of solar data mining and highlight visual
	results from work in data labeling, classification, and clustering.
	Lastly, we present an overview of the first-ever Content-Based Image
	Retrieval (CBIR) system for solar images, and conclude with a brief
	look at the direction of our future research. },

  journal = {Science},

  pages = {2319-2323},
  number = {5500},
  abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such
	as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions,
	regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding
	meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional
	observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday
	perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000
	auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small
	number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach
	to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured
	local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry
	of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component
	analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is
	capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie
	complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images
	of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous
	algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently
	computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class
	of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the
	true structure.},
