  abstract    = {{Several recently published shape retrieval systems have achieved high accuracy on a benchmark 1400-shape dataset. However, some of these systems have high pairwise shape matching costs due to their use of structural matching or flexible correspondence. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a relatively simple shape retrieval system based on fixed point correspondences can achieve accuracy comparable with the two most accurate prior systems, at significantly higher speed. High accuracy is achieved by using a stable curve normalization procedure and example-based retrieval. High speed is achieved by three techniques: single key-point alignment, fixed correspondences, and PCA-based dimensionality reduction. The system is completely automatic and does not require that the database shapes have class labels. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract = {Abstract Shape analysis and recognition play an important role in the design of robust and reliable computer vision systems. Such systems rely on feature extraction to provide meaningful information and representation of shapes and images. However, accurate feature extraction is not a trivial task since it may depend on parameter adjustment, application domain and the shape data set itself. Indeed, there is a demand for computational tools to understand and support parameter adjustment and therefore unfold shape description representation, since manual parameter choices may not be suitable for real applications. Our major contribution is the definition of an evolutionary optimization methodology that fully supports parameter adjustment of a multiscale shape descriptor for feature extraction and representation of leaf shapes in a high dimensional space. Here, intelligent evolutionary optimization methods search for parameters that best fit the normalized multiscale bending energy descriptor for leaf shape retrieval and classification. The simulated annealing, differential evolution and particle swarm optimization methods optimize an objective function, which is based on the silhouette measure, to achieve the set of optimal parameters. Our methodology improves leaf shape characterization and recognition due to the intrinsic shape differences which are embedded in the set of optimized parameters. Experiments were conducted on public benchmark data sets with the normalized multiscale bending energy and inner-distance shape context descriptors. The visual exploratory data analysis techniques showed that the proposed methodology minimized the total within-cluster variance and thus, improved the leaf shape clustering. Moreover, supervised and unsupervised classification experiments with plant leaves accomplished high Precision and Recall rates as well as Bulls-eye scores with the optimized parameters. },

But it can also be considered as a natural generalization of linear principal component analysis. This gives rise to the question how to use nonlinear features for data compression, reconstruction, and de-noising, applications common in linear PCA. This is a nontrivial task, as the results provided by kernel PCA live in some high dimensional feature space and need not have pre-images in input space. This work presents ideas for finding approximate pre-images, focusing on Gaussian kernels, and shows experimental results using these pre-images in data reconstruction and de-noising on toy examples as well as on real world data.}},

By considering a mapping to a high-dimensional. feature space and application of the kernel trick (Mercer theorem) kernel PCA is obtained as introduced by Scholkopf et al. While least squares support vector machine classifiers have a natural link with kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (minimizing the within class scatter around targets + 1 and -1), for PCA analysis one can take the interpretation of a one-class modeling problem with zero target value around which one maximizes the variance. The score variables are interpreted as error variables within the problem formulation. In this way primal-dual constrained optimization problem interpretations to linear and kernel PCA analysis are obtained in a similar style as for least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers.}},

This algorithm generalizes the minimum error criteria of signal reconstruction to feature space, which can automatically recognize the outliers in the training sample set, and exterminates their effects to the accuracy of the KPCA algorithm via iterative computing. The robust KPCA algorithm not only remains non-linearity property of KPCA but gets better robustness and improves the accuracy of KPCA. The simulation experiments show that the robust KPCA algorithm developed is better than the KPCA algorithm.}},

  abstract = {Abstract It is known that size alone, which is often defined as the volume-equivalent diameter, is not sufficient to characterize many particulate products. The shape of crystalline products can be as important as size in many applications. Traditionally, particulate shape is often defined by several simple descriptors such as the maximum length and the aspect ratio. Although these descriptors are intuitive, they result in a loss of information about the original shape. This paper presents a method to use principal component analysis to derive simple latent shape descriptors from microscope images of particulate products made in batch processes, and the use of these descriptors to identify batch-to-batch variations. Data from batch runs of both a laboratory crystalliser and an industrial crystallisation reactor are analysed using the described approach. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the use of traditional shape descriptors that have physical meanings and Fourier shape descriptors are also made. },
