	high accuracy on a benchmark 1400-shape dataset. However, some of
	these systems have high pairwise shape matching costs due to their

	of this paper is to demonstrate that a relatively simple shape retrieval
	system based on fixed point correspondences can achieve accuracy
	comparable with the two most accurate prior systems, at significantly
	higher speed. High accuracy is achieved by using a stable curve normalization
	procedure and example-based retrieval. High speed is achieved by
	three techniques: single key-point alignment, fixed correspondences,
	and PCA-based dimensionality reduction. The system is completely
	automatic and does not require that the database shapes have class
	labels. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

	feature space and application of the kernel trick (Mercer theorem)
	kernel PCA is obtained as introduced by Scholkopf et al. While least
	squares support vector machine classifiers have a natural link with

	scatter around targets + 1 and -1), for PCA analysis one can take
	the interpretation of a one-class modeling problem with zero target
	value around which one maximizes the variance. The score variables
	are interpreted as error variables within the problem formulation.
	In this way primal-dual constrained optimization problem interpretations
	to linear and kernel PCA analysis are obtained in a similar style
	as for least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers.}},
